## Understanding User Segments

Think of segments as different groups of users you want to target. We offer three ways to create these groups:

### Default Segments
These are your ready-to-use segments, like "All users". They're created automatically and can't be changed - perfect for broad targeting.

### Attribute-Based Segments
Need to target users based on specific characteristics? This is where you'll create segments based on user or company attributes:

1. Head to the Users page
2. Look for the filter panel on the left
3. Pick the attributes you want to filter by
4. Choose which columns to show
5. Hit **Save segment** to either update an existing one or create a new one

> **Heads up**: If you're using `identify()` in `usertour.js`, remember that User ID and Company ID aren't automatically created as attributes. To use them in filters, you'll need to send them as attributes in the second argument.

### Manual Segments
Got a list of specific users you want to target? Maybe from a spreadsheet or your CRM? Manual segments are perfect for this:

1. Click the **+ New** button above the segment list
2. Pick your users from the list
3. Match them by email or user ID
4. Save and you're done!
