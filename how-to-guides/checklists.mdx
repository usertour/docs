## Overview

Checklists are powerful tools for user onboarding and task completion. They provide:
- A reliable anchor for new users
- Clear progress tracking
- Easy access to related tours
- A sense of achievement
- Persistent guidance throughout the user journey

## Creating Checklists

### Basic Setup
1. Navigate to the **Checklists** page in the sidebar
2. Create a new checklist
3. Configure auto-start conditions
4. Publish your checklist

The checklist will automatically appear in your application via [Usertour.js](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview) - no additional installation required.

- Completion condition

For example, you can create a task that:
- Triggers when users create their first project
- Launches a guided tour
- Updates the checklist progress
