## Delete content

When you no longer need certain Usertour content (like flows, launchers, checklists) to be active, we recommend unpublishing them from the environment where you don't want them to run. This way, you can keep all the analytics data and have the option to republish them later if needed. For more details, check out our Environments and versions guide.

## Duplicate content

Need to create new content based on your existing Usertour items? You can easily duplicate any of your flows, launchers, and checklists. Just go to the item you want to copy, click the three-dot menu in the top right corner, and select the duplicate option.
