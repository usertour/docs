Usertour offers 3 self-hosted pricing plans: **Free, Business, Enterprise**. Both **Business** and **Enterprise** plans require purchasing a license. You can [contact us](https://tally.so/r/n904o1).


## Configure Project License

Navigate to the **Settings > Subscription**, click **Upload License** and upload your license.

<Note>
If you're using a version earlier than 0.3.0, you won't see this configuration option. Version 0.3.0 shows "Update License", while versions after 0.3.0 show "Upload License".
