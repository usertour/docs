## Overview

Environments in Usertour help you:
- Isolate development from production
- Test changes safely
- Manage different user groups
- Control content deployment
- Maintain separate configurations

Each environment has its own unique `Usertour.js` token, ensuring complete isolation between your staging and production users.

## Managing Environments

### Creating a New Environment

1. Navigate to [Settings → Environments](https://app.usertour.io/project/1/settings/environments)
2. Click **Create new environment**
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Staging", "Development")
4. Save your changes

A new `Usertour.js` token will be generated automatically.

**Using Environment Tokens**

1. Copy the generated token
2. Update your `Usertour.js` snippet with the new token
3. Deploy to your target environment
4. Verify the connection

<Note>
 Each environment's token is unique and should only be used in its designated environment.

### Version Control
Managing your content across different environments is a breeze with Usertour's version control system. Think of it as a time machine for your flows - you can always go back to a previous version if needed!

When you open the Versions tab under any flow, you'll see:

Here's what you can do:
- View your version history - we automatically save versions when you publish or when multiple team members make changes
- Click the three dots menu (⋯) next to any version to:
  - Publish that version to any environment
  - Restore it if you want to undo recent changes

### Publishing to a Specific Environment
Ready to share your changes with your users? Here's how to publish to a specific environment:

1. Open the flow you want to publish
2. Click the Publish button
3. Choose which environment you want to publish to (just uncheck Development if you don't want it there)
4. Hit Publish to Production and you're done!

### Unpublishing from an Environment
Oops! Published something by mistake? No worries - you can easily unpublish it:

1. Head to the Versions tab
2. Click the three dots menu (⋯) in the top right corner
3. Select Unpublish
4. Find the environment you want to unpublish from
5. Click the Unpublish button to confirm

That's it! Your content will be removed from that environment. You can also use this same menu to publish the latest version of your flow whenever you need to.

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Naming**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Follow your team's conventions
   - Include environment type
   - Add version numbers if needed

2. **Token Management**
   - Keep tokens secure
   - Don't share between environments
   - Document token usage
   - Rotate tokens regularly

3. **Content Management**
   - Test changes in staging first
   - Use version control
   - Document environment differences
   - Maintain consistent configurations

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Plan your deployments
   - Test thoroughly
   - Monitor performance
   - Have a rollback plan

> **Tip**: Always test your flows in a staging environment before deploying to production to ensure a smooth user experience.
