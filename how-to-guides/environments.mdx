## Overview

Environments in Usertour help you:
- Isolate development from production
- Test changes safely
- Manage different user groups
- Control content deployment
- Maintain separate configurations

Each environment has its own unique `Usertour.js` token, ensuring complete isolation between your staging and production users.

## Managing Environments

### Creating a New Environment

1. Navigate to [Settings â†’ Environments](https://app.usertour.io/project/1/settings/environments)
2. Click **Create new environment**
3. Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "Staging", "Development")
4. Save your changes

A new `Usertour.js` token will be generated automatically.

### Using Environment Tokens

1. Copy the generated token
2. Update your `Usertour.js` snippet with the new token
3. Deploy to your target environment
4. Verify the connection

> **Note**: Each environment's token is unique and should only be used in its designated environment.

## Best Practices

1. **Environment Naming**
   - Use clear, descriptive names
   - Follow your team's conventions
   - Include environment type
   - Add version numbers if needed

2. **Token Management**
   - Keep tokens secure
   - Don't share between environments
   - Document token usage
   - Rotate tokens regularly

3. **Content Management**
   - Test changes in staging first
   - Use version control
   - Document environment differences
   - Maintain consistent configurations

4. **Deployment Strategy**
   - Plan your deployments
   - Test thoroughly
   - Monitor performance
   - Have a rollback plan

> **Tip**: Always test your flows in a staging environment before deploying to production to ensure a smooth user experience.
