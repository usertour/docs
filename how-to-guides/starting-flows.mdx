## Automatic Flow Triggers

You can set up flows to start automatically based on various conditions. These conditions are configured in the flow settings panel.

## Available Trigger Conditions

### User-Based Triggers
- **User Attributes**: Start flows based on user or company data
  - Configure via [Usertour.js](/developers/usertourjs-reference/installation)
  - Perfect for personalized experiences
  - Example: Show different flows for free vs. paid users

### Page-Based Triggers
- **Current Page**: Trigger flows on specific pages
  - Automatically tracked by Usertour.js
  - Great for page-specific guidance
  - Example: Show onboarding on the dashboard

### Flow-Based Triggers
- **Flow Completion**: Start flows after other flows
  - Chain multiple flows together
  - Create sequential experiences
  - Example: Show advanced features after basic onboarding

### Element-Based Triggers
- **UI Element Presence**: Start when elements appear
- **Element Interaction**: Start on element click
  - Perfect for feature discovery
  - Example: Show tooltip when user hovers over a new feature

### Input-Based Triggers
- **Specific Input Value**: Start on exact input match
- **Any Input**: Start when user enters any value
  - Great for form guidance
  - Example: Show help when user starts typing

### Time-Based Triggers
- **Scheduled Start**: Set specific dates and times
  - Before or after a target time
  - Perfect for time-sensitive content
  - Example: Show holiday promotion at specific times

## Advanced Configuration

### Combining Conditions
You can create complex trigger logic by:
- Combining multiple conditions
- Using AND/OR logic groups
- Creating sophisticated user journeys

### Flow Frequency
Control how often flows appear:
- **Default**: Once per user
- **Unlimited**: Multiple times
  - Add condition: `Flow started exactly 0 times in the last 1 hr where flow id is <flow id>`
  - Prevents restart on dismissal

### Timing Control
Add delays to your flows:
- Use the Wait condition
- Set specific delay times
- Ensure proper page loading
- Create smoother user experiences

> **Tip**: Always test your flow triggers in different scenarios to ensure they work as expected.
