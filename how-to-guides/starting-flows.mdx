### Element-Based Conditions

## Advanced Configuration

### Combining Conditions
You can create complex trigger logic by:
- Combining multiple conditions
- Using AND/OR logic groups
- Creating sophisticated user journeys

### Flow Frequency
Control how often flows appear:
- **Default**: Once per user
- **Unlimited**: Multiple times
  - Add condition: `Flow started exactly 0 times in the last 1 hr where flow id is <flow id>`
  - Prevents restart on dismissal

### Timing Control
Add delays to your flows:
- Use the Wait condition
- Set specific delay times
- Ensure proper page loading
- Create smoother user experiences

> **Tip**: Always test your flow conditions in different scenarios to ensure they work as expected.
