## Views and completion rate over time

The **Analytics** tab under a flow shows how many users have seen your flow over time.

* **Unique views** tells you how many unique users have seen the flow in total. There’s also a total number of views, which may be higher if some users have seen the flow multiple times..

* **Completion rate** tells you the ratio of users that saw the flow who also completed it.

## Setting up Companies

The **Step funnel** shows you where users drop off in the flow.

* **Unique views**  shows how many users saw each step.

* **View rate** shows the share of users that saw the step relative to the total number of users that saw the flow.

* The width of the green bar corresponds to the View rate.

* If your flow is linear, the shape of the bars will resemble a funnel (wider at the top, narrower at the bottom).

* If there’s a steep drop after a certain step, it’s a hint that users have a hard time continuing from it or simply lose interest. Consider previewing the flow and look for issues, shorten the flow and/or make the content more concise and engaging.

* Note that if the flow has branching or steps that can be skipped, the chart may not look like an actual funnel, since a step’s bar may be shorter than a later step.

## Recent sessions

A **session** is a user’s journey through a flow and corresponds to a view. A user may have multiple sessions of a flow, which will result in multiple views (though only 1 unique view).

* You can click a user’s name to go to their profile, or click an individual row to view more information about the session.

* Each row contains the session’s current progress: How far they’ve gotten, whether they’ve completed/dismissed the flow, and which step they’re currently on.
