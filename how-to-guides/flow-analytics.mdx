## Understanding Flow Performance

Want to know how your flows are performing? The **Analytics** tab gives you a clear picture of user engagement and flow effectiveness.

### Key Metrics
- **Unique Views**: How many different users have seen your flow
- **Total Views**: The total number of times your flow has been viewed (including repeat views)
- **Completion Rate**: The percentage of users who finish the entire flow

## Step-by-Step Analysis

The **Step Funnel** shows you exactly where users might be dropping off or getting stuck:

### What to Look For
- **Unique Views**: How many users reached each step
- **View Rate**: The percentage of users who saw each step
- **Funnel Shape**: 
  - A perfect funnel (wider at top, narrower at bottom) means users are progressing naturally
  - Sudden drops indicate potential issues
  - Branching flows may show different patterns

### Improving Your Flow
If you notice a steep drop after a particular step:
- Review the step's content
- Check for technical issues
- Consider simplifying the flow
- Make the content more engaging

> **Note**: For flows with branching paths or skippable steps, the funnel might not look traditional, as some users might skip ahead or take different paths.

## Recent User Sessions

Every time a user starts your flow, it creates a new session. The **Recent Sessions** list shows you who's been using your flow lately:

### Session Details
- Click a user's name to view their profile
- Click the horizontal dots (â‹¯) on the right to view detailed session information
- Track current progress
- See completion status
- Monitor current step

### What You Can Learn
- Which users are engaging with your flow
- How far they're getting
- Where they're dropping off
- Whether they're completing or dismissing the flow

> **Pro tip**: Use this data to identify patterns and make informed decisions about improving your flows.
