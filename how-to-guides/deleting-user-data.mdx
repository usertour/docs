## Delete a User Completely

This will remove all information Usertour has about a user.

Here's how to do it:
1. Go to the [Users page](https://app.usertour.io/env/1/users) and find the user 
2. Select the row with the user's information
3. Click "Delete user"

<Tip>
If the user signs into your app again (and ```usertour.identify()``` is called), they'll be recreated in Usertour - but without any history of completed flows.

## Delete a Single Flow/Checklist/Launcher Session

This only deletes the record for a single session. This is useful when you want to:
- Make a flow/checklist eligible for auto-start again (if it has auto-start conditions)
- Show a launcher again if it was previously dismissed

Here's how to do it:
1. Go to the content's detail page
2. Select one of the user's flow sessions
3. Click the three-dot menu on the right
4. Select "Delete session"

## Dismiss a Flow for All Users

You can dismiss a flow for everyone by unpublishing it. This is especially helpful when:
- You accidentally published the wrong flow
- You have an old version running with an error that's causing users to get stuck (preventing other flows from starting)

Important note: In these cases, publishing a new version won't help because users who already started the flow will stay on the old version.

However, for checklists and launchers, publishing a new version will automatically update users to the latest version, even if they're currently using it.
