Companies is a powerful feature that enables you to model multiple users belonging to the same company/organization/account/team in your app. This allows for efficient targeting, personalization and tracking.

Your app may refer to it as organizations, companies, teams, accounts etc. In Usertour we just use the common word, companies, to refer to a group of users who belong to the same entity.

## Key benefits of Companies

With Companies, you can easily manage content based on company attributes, or events performed by any user in a company.

* **Elegantly manage users that belongs to multiple companies** in your app. Usertour can understand if a user has different permission roles in two different companies.

* **Control content targeting and completion** based on the entire company’s behavior, instead of just a single user.

* **Gain overview of users** within a company. You get an aggregated overview of their activities.

## Setting up Companies

Setting up Companies is easily done by calling usertour.group(companyId) in your Usertour.js installation. Just like with users, you can also pass company and company membership attributes via Usertour.js

## Using Companies

There are many ways to utilize Companies.

Once you have configured Companies, they’ll show up on the **Companies** page in the sidebar below **Users**.
