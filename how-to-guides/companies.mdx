## Overview

Companies in Usertour helps you manage users who belong to the same organization, whether you call them companies, teams, or accounts in your app. It's perfect for:
- Targeting content to entire organizations
- Tracking company-wide behavior
- Managing multi-company users
- Personalizing experiences
- Understanding team dynamics

## Why Use Companies?

### Multi-Company Support
Users often belong to multiple organizations. Maybe they're an admin in one company and a regular user in another. Usertour understands these relationships and helps you:
- Track different roles
- Manage permissions
- Customize experiences
- Handle complex scenarios

### Company-Wide Insights
Instead of looking at individual users, you can:
- Track company-level activity
- Measure team engagement
- Monitor group behavior
- Make data-driven decisions

### User Management
Get a clear view of:
- Who's in each company
- What they're doing
- How they're engaging
- Where they need help

## Getting Started

### Setup
It's simple to get started with Companies. Just add this to your [Usertour.js installation](/developers/usertourjs-reference/installation):

```javascript
usertour.group(companyId, {
  // Optional company attributes
  name: "Acme Corp",
  plan: "enterprise",
  // Optional membership attributes
  role: "admin"
});
```

### Using Companies

Once you've set up Companies, you'll find them in the sidebar under **Companies**. Here's what you can do:

> **Pro tip**: Use company attributes to create targeted experiences for different types of organizations, like showing enterprise features to premium companies or onboarding flows to new teams.
