Usertour's survey feature lets you build in-app surveys to:
- Measure customer satisfaction (NPS, CSAT, CES)
- Collect user feedback
- Conduct user research
- Personalize user experiences

Since surveys are built on top of flows, you get all the power of Usertour's Flow Builder, including:
- Logic-based triggers
- Conditional branching
- Flexible placement
- Behavior-based timing

## Common Use Cases

### 1. NPS Surveys
Show a Net Promoter Score survey to active customers, typically 30 days after subscription.

### 2. CSAT/CES Surveys
Measure customer satisfaction or effort after completing specific tasks.

### 3. Feature Feedback
Collect feedback about:
- New features you've built
- Features you're considering building

### 4. User Profiling
Ask new users questions to personalize their experience:
- "What is your role within your company?"
- "How experienced are you with X software?"
- "What is your primary goal with using our software?"
