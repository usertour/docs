## Summary  

UserTour.js supports forwarding events to popular analytics platforms via their JavaScript SDKs. To use these integrations, your client must include each provider’s SDK snippet and initialize it correctly in the `<head>` (or before the closing `</body>`) of your application. Once loaded, UserTour.js will detect the global objects (e.g. `gtag`, `amplitude`, `mixpanel`) and dispatch events automatically.

## Available Integrations  

Currently supported integrations rely on client-side SDKs:  
- **Google Analytics (gtag.js)**  
- **Amplitude Browser SDK**  
- **HubSpot JavaScript API**  
- **Intercom JavaScript API**  
- **Klaviyo JavaScript SDK**  
- **LogRocket Web SDK**  
- **Mixpanel JavaScript SDK**  
- **PostHog JavaScript SDK**  
- **Segment Analytics.js**  

> _Note:_ These integrations depend on the provider’s global objects being available on `window`.
