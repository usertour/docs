<Warning>
**Development/Testing Environment**:\
We strongly recommend using Docker Compose for development and testing environments. This provides a quick and easy setup with all dependencies included.

**Production Environment**:\
For production deployments, we do **not** recommend using Docker Compose with Redis and PostgreSQL included. Instead:
- Deploy Redis and PostgreSQL using cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, etc.) or build your own infrastructure with high availability
- Deploy only the Usertour application using the published [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/usertour/usertour/) image and configure Redis and PostgreSQL through environment variables
</Warning>
