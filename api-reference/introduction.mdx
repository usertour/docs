## Base URL

The Usertour API is built on **REST** principles. We enforce **HTTPS** in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.usertour.io
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being ```Bearer ak_123456789``` where ```ak_123456789``` is your [API Key](https://app.usertour.io/project/1/settings/api).

```
Authorization: Bearer ak_123456789
```

## Response codes
Usertour uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, ```2xx``` HTTP codes correspond to success, ```4xx``` codes are for user-related failures, and ```5xx``` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ```200```     | Successful request.                     |
| ```400```     | Check that the parameters were correct. |
| ```401```     | The API key used was missing.          |
| ```403```     | The API key used was invalid.          |
| ```404```     | The resource was not found.            |
| ```429```     | The rate limit was exceeded.           |
| ```5xx```     | Indicates an error with Usertour servers. |

## Rate limit

The API employs 2 safeguards against bursts of incoming traffic to help maximize its stability:

- A rate limiter that limits the number of requests per Usertour account per minute. Your account's limit depends on your plan. See [Pricing](https://www.usertour.io/pricing). If you exceed this limit, you may receive error responses with HTTP status code ```429 Too Many Requests```.
- A concurrency limiter that limits the number of requests that are active at any given time. If the API is at high capacity, it may delay responding to some requests. If requests are queued for more than 15 seconds, you may receive error responses with HTTP status code ```503 Service Unavailable```. Problems with concurrency limiting should be very rare. We strive to have enough capacity at all times to avoid (or at least minimize) queuing and never timing out.
