## Base URL

The Usertour API is built on **REST** principles. We enforce **HTTPS** in every request to improve data security, integrity, and privacy. The API does not support **HTTP**.

All requests contain the following base URL:

```
https://api.usertour.io
```

## Authentication

To authenticate you need to add an Authorization header with the contents of the header being ```Bearer ak_123456789``` where ```ak_123456789``` is your [API Key](https://app.usertour.io/project/1/settings/api).

```
Authorization: Bearer ak_123456789
```

## Response codes
Usertour uses standard HTTP codes to indicate the success or failure of your requests.

In general, ```2xx``` HTTP codes correspond to success, ```4xx``` codes are for user-related failures, and ```5xx``` codes are for infrastructure issues.

| Status | Description                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| ```200```     | Successful request.                     |
| ```400```     | Check that the parameters were correct. |
| ```401```     | The API key used was missing.          |
| ```403```     | The API key used was invalid.          |
| ```404```     | The resource was not found.            |
| ```429```     | The rate limit was exceeded.           |
| ```5xx```     | Indicates an error with Usertour servers. |

<Note>Check [**Error Codes**](/api-reference/errors) for a comprehensive breakdown of all possible API errors.</Note>


## Rate limit

The API implements two protection mechanisms to ensure service stability:

1. **Request Rate Limiter**
   - Enforces per-account request limits per minute
   - Rate limits vary based on your subscription plan (see [Pricing](https://www.usertour.io/pricing))
   - Exceeding the limit returns HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests)

2. **Concurrency Limiter**
   - Controls simultaneous active requests
   - Implements request queuing when at high capacity
   - Queue timeout: 15 seconds
   - Returns HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) if queued too long
   - Note: This is a rare occurrence as we maintain sufficient capacity to minimize queuing

<Note>For optimal integration, implement proper error handling for both 429 and 503 responses. Consider implementing retry logic with exponential backoff when receiving these status codes.</Note>
