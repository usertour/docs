title: 'Upsert a company'
api: 'Post /v1/companies'
description: "Create a new company or update an existing one. This endpoint uses an upsert operation, creating a new company if the ID doesn't exist, or updating the existing company if it does."
---

## Overview

The create/update endpoint provides a unified way to manage companies in your system. When you send a request:
- If the company ID doesn't exist, a new company will be created
- If the company ID exists, the provided attributes will be merged with existing ones
- Existing attributes not included in the request will remain unchanged

Companies can also be created or updated indirectly through:
- User creation/update operations with embedded company data
- Membership creation/update operations

## Request body

<ParamField body="id" type="string">
  Unique identifier for the company. We recommend using a consistent prefix (e.g., `comp_`) and matching the ID from your system for easier tracking and management.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="attributes" type="object">
  A map of company attributes to create or update. You can include any custom attributes to describe the company. See [Attributes](/api-reference/attributes) for detailed information about attribute types and best practices.
</ParamField>

## Response
