description: 'Companies represent organizational units in your system. They can be used to group users, manage permissions, and orchestrate user flows based on company-specific conditions.'

## Overview

Companies serve as organizational containers that group users together. In a business context, companies can represent:
- Organizations
- Teams
- Departments
- Business units

Companies support custom attributes and can be associated with events, enabling sophisticated flow orchestration based on:
- Company-wide metrics and conditions
- User behavior patterns within the company
- Cross-company relationships and hierarchies

## Object structure

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
  Unique identifier for the company. Must match the company's ID in your system. We recommend using a consistent prefix (e.g., `comp_`) for better identification.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="object" type="string">
  String representing the object's type. Always set to ```"company"```.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="attributes" type="object">
  A map of company-specific attributes. You can store any custom data to describe the company, such as:
  - Company metadata (name, industry, size)
  - Business metrics (revenue, employee count)
  - Custom flags and settings
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="createdAt" type="string">
  ISO 8601 timestamp in UTC indicating when the company was created in the system. For tracking when the company was created in your application, use a custom attribute like ```company_created_at``` in the attributes object.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="memberships" type="array | null" default="null">
  An array of [membership objects](/api-reference/company-memberships/model) representing user-company relationships. Each membership can store custom attributes that describe the relationship between the user and company (e.g., join date, status, preferences). The field defaults to ```null``` but can be [expanded](/api-reference/expanding-objects) using:
  - ```?expand=memberships``` to include basic membership data
  - ```?expand=memberships.user``` to include both membership and user details
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="users" type="array | null" default="null">
  An array of [user objects](/api-reference/users/model) representing all members of this company. Use this field when you only need user data without membership attributes. The field defaults to ```null``` but can be [expanded](/api-reference/expanding-objects) using ```?expand=users```.
</ResponseField>
