api: 'Get /v1/company-memberships'
description: 'Retrieve company memberships by expanding the memberships field of a user or company object. Direct listing of memberships is not supported.'

Company memberships are accessed through their parent objects (users or companies) using the [expansion](/api-reference/expanding-objects) feature. This design ensures proper data relationships and access control.

## Retrieving Memberships

### Through Users

To get a user's memberships:

1. Fetch the user using the [user list endpoint](/api-reference/users/list)
2. Include `?expand=memberships` in the request URL
3. The response will include the expanded memberships array

<RequestExample>
  ```bash Request
  curl https://api.usertour.io/v1/users/usr_123456789?expand=memberships \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ak_123456789' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  ```
</RequestExample>

### Through Companies

To get a company's memberships:

1. Fetch the company using the [company list endpoint](/api-reference/companies/list)
2. Include `?expand=memberships` in the request URL
3. The response will include the expanded memberships array

<RequestExample>
  ```bash Request
  curl https://api.usertour.io/v1/companies/comp_123456789?expand=memberships \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer ak_123456789' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
  ```
</RequestExample>

## Response

The expanded memberships will be included in the response as an array of [membership objects](/api-reference/company-memberships/model).

<ResponseExample>
  ```json Response
  {
    "id": "usr_123456789",
    "object": "user",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com"
    },
    "memberships": [
      {
        "id": "mem_123456789",
        "object": "membership",
        "company_id": "comp_123456789",
        "role": "admin",
        "created_at": "2024-03-20T08:30:00.000Z"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
