title: 'The company membership object'
description: 'Company memberships represent the relationship between users and companies. They allow you to store custom attributes that describe how a user interacts with a specific company.'

## Overview

Company memberships establish a flexible many-to-many relationship model between users and companies. This design allows:
- A single user to belong to multiple companies
- A company to have multiple user members
- Different roles and permissions for the same user across different companies

The membership object serves as the ideal place to store relationship-specific data, particularly user roles and permissions. For instance, a user might be an Owner in one company while serving as an Admin in another. This role information belongs in the membership attributes rather than the user or company objects, as it represents the specific relationship between a user and a company.

Company memberships serve as the connection between users and companies, enabling you to:
- Track user-company relationships
- Store relationship-specific attributes
- Manage user access and permissions
- Track membership history and changes
