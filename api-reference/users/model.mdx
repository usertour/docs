title: 'The user object'
---

<ResponseField name="id" type="string" >
  A unique identifier for the user. This ID should match the user's identifier in your system.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="object" type="string" >
  The object type identifier. Always set to "user" to distinguish it from other API objects.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="attributes" type="object">
  A collection of user attributes. You can include any custom attributes to describe the user. See [Attributes](/api-reference/attributes) for details.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="createdAt" type="string" >
  The timestamp when the user was created in the system, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ). Note: This is not the user's signup time in your application - use a custom attribute like `signed_up_at` for that.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="companies" type="array | null" default="null">
  A list of [company objects](/api-reference/companies/model) that the user belongs to. This field is useful when you only need company information without membership details. If you need membership attributes (like roles or permissions), use the `memberships` field instead. Can be expanded using `?expand=companies`.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="memberships" type="array | null" default="null">
  A list of [company membership objects](/api-reference/company-memberships/model) representing the user's company memberships. Each membership includes:
  - Company-specific attributes (e.g., role, access level)
  - Reference to the associated [company object](/api-reference/companies/model)
  
  Available expansion options:
  - `?expand=memberships`: Include basic membership data
  - `?expand=memberships.company`: Include both membership and company details
</ResponseField>
