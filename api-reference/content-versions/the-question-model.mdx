title: 'The question object'
---

The question object represents a survey question within a content version. It defines the structure and type of the question, along with its metadata.

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
  A unique identifier for the question. Important: The ID of questions changes between versions. When a new version is created, all components are copied with new ID values. Use `cvid` for stable cross-version identification.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="object" type="string">
  The object type identifier. Always set to "question" to distinguish it from other API objects.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="cvid" type="string">
  Cross-Version ID (CVID). A stable identifier that remains constant for the same logical question across different versions. Use this instead of `id` when referencing questions, as it persists across version changes.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string">
  The name of the question as defined in the Builder interface.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="type" type="string">
  The type of question. Supported values:
  - "nps" - Net Promoter Score (0-10)
  - "star-rating" - Star rating (1-5)
  - "multi-line-text" - Multi-line text input
  - "multiple-choice" - Multiple choice selection
  - "single-line-text" - Single line text input
  - "scale" - Scale rating (1-10)
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="updatedAt" type="string">

</ResponseField>
