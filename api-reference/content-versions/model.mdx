Content versions represent different iterations of your content (flows, checklists, and launchers). A new version is automatically created when you make edits or publish content, allowing you to track changes and maintain a history of your content's evolution.

<ResponseField name="id" type="string">
  A unique identifier for the content version.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="object" type="string">
  The object type identifier. Always set to "contentVersion" to distinguish it from other API objects.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="number" type="integer">
  The version number of the content. Version numbers are incremental for each content object, starting from 1.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="questions" type="array | null" default="null">
  A collection of [question objects](/api-reference/content-versions/the-question-model) associated with this version. This field is only populated for flow content types and can be expanded using the `?expand=questions` query parameter.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="updatedAt" type="string">
  The timestamp when the version was last updated, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="createdAt" type="string">
  The timestamp when the version was created, in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ).
