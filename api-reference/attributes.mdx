title: 'Attributes'
description: 'Objects in the API, such as users, companies, and events, can store custom attributes in the ```attributes``` object. This allows you to extend the default data model with your own fields.'

## Attribute naming

Attribute names must follow these rules:
- Only use alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9)
- Can include underscores, dashes, and spaces
- Are case-sensitive
- Must be unique within the ```attributes``` object

We recommend using ```snake_case``` for all attribute names to maintain consistency across your application. For example:
- ```user_id```
- ```created_at```
- ```last_login_time```

You can configure human-friendly display names for attributes in the Usertour UI. For instance, ```signed_up_at``` can be displayed as "Signed Up" in the interface.

## Attribute data types

We support the following attribute data types:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ```string``` | Represents a string. |
| ```number``` | Represents a number (supports both integers and floating point numbers). |
| ```boolean``` | Represents either ```true``` or ```false```. |
| ```datetime``` | Represents a point in time, always stored as ISO 8601 in UTC. |
| ```list``` | Represents a list of strings. |

## Best practices

1. **Naming conventions**
   - Use ```snake_case``` for all attribute names
   - Choose descriptive names that clearly indicate the data's purpose
   - Avoid using reserved words or system field names

2. **Data types**
   - Use the most appropriate data type for your data
   - Store dates as ```datetime``` type, not as strings
   - Use ```boolean``` for true/false values instead of strings

3. **Performance considerations**
   - Keep attribute names concise but descriptive
   - Avoid storing large amounts of data in attributes
   - Use appropriate data types to optimize storage and query performance
