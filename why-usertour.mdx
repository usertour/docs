**Usertour** is an open-source user onboarding platform designed for everyone on your team—whether you’re in product, customer success, or development. We believe great onboarding is a shared effort, but one thing is essential: **developers cannot be left out.**

In fast-moving SaaS environments, products constantly evolve with new features and UI changes. Many onboarding tools offer visual browser plugins that let non-developers build tours by clicking on page elements. While convenient, these plugins often generate fragile CSS selectors that break when the UI changes—a common problem during iteration.

## Why Developer Involvement Matters

Effective onboarding relies on reliable element anchors—CSS selectors or semantic attributes. Automatically generated selectors, if not maintained by developers, can lead to broken guides and a poor user experience.

Usertour avoids this risk by requiring **manual configuration of selectors**, giving developers direct control over how product tours attach to the interface. This results in more stable, predictable guides that stay intact even as the product changes. Developers stay in the loop, while the broader team can still collaborate on messaging, logic, and goals.

## What Makes Usertour Different

* **Stable and Reliable:** Usertour requires manual selector setup rather than relying on plugins to auto-generate them, minimizing the risk of broken tours due to UI changes.

* **Fast Iteration:** Easily update or reconfigure tours as your app evolves—no need to rebuild from scratch with every release.

* **Seamless Integration:** Integrates directly into your app’s workflow with minimal setup, no vendor lock-in, and no bloated scripts.

* **Advanced User Targeting:** Define custom user attributes and track events to segment and guide users based on behavior or profile.

* **Open-Source & Developer-Friendly:** Fully customizable and transparent. You own your data, your UI, and your deployment.

## Summary

Usertour helps SaaS teams deliver better onboarding without compromising stability or developer control. It supports rapid iteration, precise targeting, and flexible deployment—without relying on fragile plugins or complex no-code abstractions. Whether you’re guiding users through a new feature or streamlining activation, Usertour gives you a solid foundation to build on.
