## Cannot access Postgres / Redis
If using Docker and you setup your Redis or Postgres on the host machine you could use additional flag `--net="host"` for docker. In this case you will be able to use `localhost` as host in your `.env` file for redis and Postgres.

## Usertour.js version not updated

This is likely due to browser caching or third-party CDN caching (Cloudflare, Amazon CloudFront, etc.). You need to clear the cache for the following Usertour.js files, or modify the caching policies in your CDN settings:

- `/sdk/es2020/usertour.js`
- `/sdk/legacy/usertour.iife.js`

The default UserTour nginx configuration already includes cache-busting headers for these files:

```nginx
# Specific SDK files with no-cache headers
location = /sdk/es2020/usertour.js {
    alias /usr/share/nginx/html/sdk/es2020/usertour.js;
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*";
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate";
    expires -1;
}

location = /sdk/legacy/usertour.iife.js {
    alias /usr/share/nginx/html/sdk/legacy/usertour.iife.js;
    add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*";
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate";
       expires -1;
   }
   ```

## Does UserTour app support multi-instance deployment?

Yes, for production environments, we recommend installing Redis and PostgreSQL independently, and connecting the UserTour app to them via configuration files, rather than deploying Redis and PostgreSQL together with the UserTour app. This allows the UserTour app to scale horizontally based on load.
