## Installing

Here are the steps to set up Usertour for development:

### 1. Fork this repository

### 2. Clone the repo

Clone the forked repository from your terminal:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<github_username>/usertour.git
```

### 3. Verify dependencies

Usertour requires the following dependencies to build:

- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### 4. Installation

Usertour consists of multiple packages managed in a monorepo structure. The main components are:

1. Web Application (`apps/web/`): The main web interface
2. API Server (`apps/server/`): The backend server
3. SDK (`apps/sdk/`): The SDK for the web application

Follow these steps to install:

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

3. Set up environment variables for both API and web:

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
# Replace redis and postgres config in apps/server/.env
cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env
cp apps/sdk/.env.example apps/sdk/.env
```

4. Start developing:

```bash
# Start the server
pnpm dev:server

# Start the web application
pnpm dev:web

# Start the SDK
pnpm dev:sdk

```
