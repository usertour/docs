## Coolify Deployment Guide

### What is Coolify?

Coolify is an open-source, self-hostable platform-as-a-service (PaaS) that simplifies the deployment of applications. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing Docker containers, databases, and other services.


### Prerequisites

Before deploying Usertour with Coolify, ensure you have a Coolify instance running (see [Coolify installation guide](https://coolify.io/docs/installation)).

### Deployment Steps

1. **Create a New Resource in Coolify**
   
   Navigate to your Coolify dashboard, open your project, and click the **Add New Resource** button.

2. **Select Deployment Method**
   
   Choose **Public Repository** as your deployment option.
   
   <Note>
   If you're using your own repository, please select **Public Repository** or **Private Repository** based on your repository's visibility settings.
   </Note>

3. **Configure Repository URL**
   
   Enter the following repository URL (this is an example, we recommend using your own configuration):
   ```
   https://github.com/usertour/examples/blob/main/docker/docker-compose.coolify.yml
   ```
   
   Then click **Check repository** to validate the connection.
   
   <Note>
   **Recommendation**: We suggest cloning the code to your own repository and maintaining the configuration yourself for better control and customization.
   </Note>
