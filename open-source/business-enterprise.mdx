[Purchasing an Usertour license](https://tally.so/r/n904o1) enables access to additional features. 

## Setup

Navigate to **Settings > Subscription** in your UserTour dashboard and click **Upload License** to upload your license file.

<Note>
If you're using a version earlier than 0.3.0, you won't see this configuration option. Version 0.3.0 shows "Update License", while versions after 0.3.0 show "Upload License".
</Note>

After successful configuration, you'll see the **Current plan** change to **Business** or **Enterprise**, along with an expiration date displayed as **"Expires on [date]"**.

For detailed step-by-step instructions with screenshots, see our [License Setup Guide](/how-to-guides/setup-license-key).
