## Overview

Usertour.js is the client-side SDK that enables you to:
- Display interactive content (modals, tooltips, checklists, launchers) to your users
- Track user behavior and send targeting information
- Manage user properties and events for audience targeting

## Installation Steps

### 1. Basic Installation

First, follow the [standard installation guide](/developers/usertourjs-reference/installation/) to add Usertour.js to your website. This is a required step before proceeding with self-hosted configuration.

### 2. Self-Hosted Configuration

After completing the basic installation, you need to add the following configuration to connect Usertour.js to your self-hosted instance. Add this script to the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

```html
<script>
  window.USERTOURJS_ENV_VARS = {
    // WebSocket connection URL
    WS_URI: "http://localhost:8011/",
    
    // Base URL for SDK assets
    ASSETS_URI: "http://localhost:8011/sdk/",
    
    // Modern JavaScript bundle (ES2020)
    USERTOURJS_ES2020_URL: 'http://localhost:8011/sdk/es2020/usertour.js',
    
    // Legacy JavaScript bundle (IIFE)
    USERTOURJS_LEGACY_URL: "http://localhost:8011/sdk/legacy/usertour.iife.js"
  };
</script>
```

### 3. Configure URLs

If you're not using the default port (8011) or host (localhost), update the URLs in the configuration:

- `WS_URI`: WebSocket connection URL
- `ASSETS_URI`: Base URL for SDK assets
- `USERTOURJS_ES2020_URL`: URL for the modern JavaScript bundle
- `USERTOURJS_LEGACY_URL`: URL for the legacy JavaScript bundle

### 4. Next Steps

After completing both the basic installation and self-hosted configuration, you can:
1. Initialize Usertour.js in your application
2. Configure user properties and events
3. Create and deploy content to your users
