## Setup

### init()

Initializes Usertour.js to target your company. Must be called once (per page load) before you make any other call.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **token** | String, required - Your Usertour.js Token, which you can find under [Settings -> Environments](https://app.usertour.io). Note that if you have multiple environments (e.g. Production and Staging) that each environment has a unique token. |

## Users
Users are the people using your application. Usertour keeps track of your users, so we can determine which flows to show them, and remember which flows they've already seen.

### identify()

Identifies the current user with Usertour. You should call this once on any page load where a user is signed in.

If `attributes` is set, they will be merged into the user's existing attributes in Usertour. Any attributes you leave out will be left as-is in Usertour.

It's up to you which attributes you want to send to Usertour. The only required argument is `userId`. Make sure not to send any sensitive data such as passwords. We recommend sending the `name` and `email` attributes so you can easily tell users apart in Usertour without relying on IDs only, and `signed_up_at`, which is often used in flow start conditions.

If the user has any active flows, they will be displayed. If the user matches any flows' start conditions, they may be started.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **userId** | String, required - The user's ID in your database.|
| **attributes** | Object, optional - Attributes to update for the user. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes). These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.|

#### Returns 
A `Promise` that resolves once the identify call succeeds

#### Examples 
Example of sending the recommended attributes:
```javascript
usertour.identify('123456', {
  name: 'Jane Smith',
  email: 'jane@example.com',
  signed_up_at: '2021-06-14T16:25:49Z'
})

```
Minimal example of sending only userId:
```javascript
usertour.identify('123456')
```

### identifyAnonymous()

Same as [usertour.identify()](#identify), except Usertour.js will automatically assign the current user a unique ID. This ID will be stored in the user's localStorage, and will be reused on reloads.

You should only use this for anonymous users, who are not signed into your app (unauthenticated users). If they are signed in, please use [usertour.identify()](#identify) with their real user ID.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **attributes** | Object, optional - Attributes to update for the user. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes). These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.|

#### Returns 
A `Promise` that resolves once the identify call succeeds

### isIdentified()
Check if a user has been identified.

#### Returns 
`true` if `usertour.identify` or `usertour.identifyAnonymous` has been called. `false` otherwise.

### updateUser()
Updates attributes for a user that has already been identified with `usertour.identify` since the last page load.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **attributes** | Object, optional - Attributes to update for the user. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes).|

#### Returns 
A `Promise` that resolves once the update call succeeds.

### reset()
Makes Usertour forget about the current user and immediately hides any active flows.

Call this when users sign out of your app.

## Groups/companies
Groups are used to group multiple users together. In your business, groups may correspond to e.g. companies, teams or departments.

Like users, groups can have attributes. Events can also be associated with groups.

With groups, you can orchestrate the flows a user sees:

- ...based on behavior of other users in a group. Example: Show a flow if no one in a group has created a "widget" yet.
- ...based on multiple groups that the user is a member of. Example: Show a flow if the group the user is currently working on matches some condition.

### group()

Associates the currently identified user with a group/company, and optionally updates the group's attributes. You should call this once on any page where the user is working on a specific group. If the user navigates to a different group, simply call usertour.group(newGroupId) again, and Usertour will switch to using that group instead.

If attributes is set, they will be merged into the group's existing attributes in Usertour. Any attributes you leave out will be left as-is in Usertour.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **groupId** | String, required - The group/company's ID in your database.|
| **attributes** | Object, optional - [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes) to update for the group. These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.|
| **options** | Object, optional|
| **options.membership** | Object, optional - [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes) to update for the user's membership of the group. Some attributes neither belong on users, nor on groups. One example is a user's "role". A user can have different roles in different groups. A group's members can have different roles. Attributes like "role" are membership attributes. They can be used in the Usertour UI just like group attributes.|

#### Returns 
A `Promise` that resolves once the group call succeeds.

### updateGroup()
Updates attributes for a group that has already been registered with `usertour.group` since the last page load.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **attributes** | Object, optional - Attributes to update for the group. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes).|

#### Returns 
A `Promise` that resolves once the update call succeeds.


## Advanced usage

### setBaseZIndex()
Usertour by default places all its floating elements at a z-index at (or slightly above) 1000000. Note that due to stacking of multiple Usertour layers, some actual z-index values may be several thousands higher.

If your own app has elements that placed at higher z-index values than this, then Usertour's elements may be shown below your own app's content. In this case, you may want to raise Usertour's base z-index value.

Note that you do not always need to change the base z-index. E.g. for the launchers, checklists and the resource center you can change their individual z-index. For launchers you can do it via the advanced settings and for the checklists and resource center you can do it via the theme settings.

#### Parameters
| Parameter | Description |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **baseZIndex** | Number, required - The minimum z-index that Usertour will place floating elements at.|
