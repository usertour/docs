title: "isIdentified()"
description: "Check if the current user has been identified"
---

The `isIdentified()` method checks whether the current user has been identified with either `usertour.identify()` or `usertour.identifyAnonymous()`.

## Returns
`boolean` - Returns `true` if the user has been identified, `false` otherwise.

## Example

```javascript
// Check if the current user is identified
if (usertour.isIdentified()) {
  // User has been identified
  console.log('User is identified');
} else {
  // User has not been identified
  console.log('User is not identified');
}
```

## Notes

- This method is useful for checking the identification state before making other Usertour.js calls
- Returns `true` for both authenticated and anonymous users
- Returns `false` if neither `identify()` nor `identifyAnonymous()` has been called
