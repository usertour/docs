title: "identifyAnonymous()"
description: "Identify anonymous users with automatically generated IDs"
---

The `identifyAnonymous()` method works similarly to [usertour.identify()](/developers/usertourjs-reference/users/identify), but automatically generates and manages a unique ID for anonymous users. This ID is stored in the user's localStorage and persists across page reloads.

> **Important**: Only use this method for unauthenticated users. For signed-in users, use [usertour.identify()](/developers/usertourjs-reference/users/identify) with their actual user ID.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="attributes" type="object">
  User attributes to update. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes) for details. These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.
</ParamField>

## Returns
A `Promise` that resolves when the identification is complete.

## Example

```javascript
// Identify an anonymous user with custom attributes
usertour.identifyAnonymous({
  last_visited: '2024-03-20T08:30:00.000Z',
  referrer: 'google.com'
});
```

## Notes

- The generated ID persists in localStorage until cleared
- Use this method only for public pages where users aren't logged in
