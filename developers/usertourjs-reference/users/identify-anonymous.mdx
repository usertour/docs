title: "identifyAnonymous()"
---

Same as [usertour.identify()](/developers/usertourjs-reference/users/identify), except Usertour.js will automatically assign the current user a unique ID. This ID will be stored in the user's localStorage, and will be reused on reloads.

You should only use this for anonymous users, who are not signed into your app (unauthenticated users). If they are signed in, please use [usertour.identify()](/developers/usertourjs-reference/users/identify) with their real user ID.

### Parameters

<ParamField path="attributes" type="object" >
Attributes to update for the user. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes). These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.
</ParamField>

### Returns 
A `Promise` that resolves once the identify call succeeds
