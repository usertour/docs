The `updateUser()` method updates attributes for a user that has already been identified with `usertour.identify()` since the last page load.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="attributes" type="object">
  User attributes to update. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes) for details. These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.
</ParamField>

## Returns
A `Promise` that resolves when the update is complete.

## Example

```javascript
// Update user attributes
usertour.updateUser({
  last_login: '2024-03-20T08:30:00.000Z',
  subscription_tier: 'premium'
});
```

## Notes

- This method only works for users identified with `usertour.identify()`
- Attributes are merged with existing values
- Does not affect the user's identification status
- Can be called multiple times to update different attributes
