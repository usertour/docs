The `reset()` method clears the current user's identification and immediately hides any active flows. Call this method when users sign out of your application.

## Example

```javascript
// Clear user identification on sign out
function handleSignOut() {
  usertour.reset();
  // ... other sign out logic
}
```

## Notes

- This method should be called when users sign out
- All active flows will be hidden immediately
- User identification will be cleared
- Any pending flow conditions will be reset
