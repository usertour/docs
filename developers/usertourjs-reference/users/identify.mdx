title: "identify()"
description: "Identify authenticated users with their unique ID and attributes"
---

The `identify()` method registers the current user with Usertour. Call this method once on each page load where a user is signed in.

When you provide `attributes`, they will be merged with the user's existing attributes in Usertour. Attributes not included in the call will retain their current values.

> **Note**: Only the `userId` parameter is required. We recommend including `name`, `email`, and `signed_up_at` attributes to help identify users in Usertour and support flow conditions. Do not send sensitive data such as passwords.

If the user has any active flows, they will be displayed. New flows may start if the user matches their start conditions.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="userId" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the user in your system.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="attributes" type="object">
  User attributes to update. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes) for details. These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.
</ParamField>

## Returns
A `Promise` that resolves when the identification is complete.

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```javascript
// Identify a user with only their ID
usertour.identify('123456');
```

### With Recommended Attributes
```javascript
// Identify a user with recommended attributes
usertour.identify('123456', {
  name: 'Jane Smith',
  email: 'jane@example.com',
  signed_up_at: '2021-06-14T16:25:49Z'
});
```

## Notes

- Call this method once per page load for authenticated users
- The `userId` must be unique within your system
- Attributes are merged with existing values
- Active flows will be displayed immediately
- New flows may start based on conditions
