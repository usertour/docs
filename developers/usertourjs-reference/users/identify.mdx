title: "identify()"
---

Identifies the current user with Usertour. You should call this once on any page load where a user is signed in.

If `attributes` is set, they will be merged into the user's existing attributes in Usertour. Any attributes you leave out will be left as-is in Usertour.

It's up to you which attributes you want to send to Usertour. The only required argument is `userId`. Make sure not to send any sensitive data such as passwords. We recommend sending the `name` and `email` attributes so you can easily tell users apart in Usertour without relying on IDs only, and `signed_up_at`, which is often used in flow start conditions.

If the user has any active flows, they will be displayed. If the user matches any flows' start conditions, they may be started.

### Parameters

<ParamField path="userId" type="string" required>
The user's ID in your database.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="attributes" type="object" >
Attributes to update for the user. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes). These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.
</ParamField>

### Returns 
A `Promise` that resolves once the identify call succeeds

### Examples 
Example of sending the recommended attributes:
```javascript
usertour.identify('123456', {
  name: 'Jane Smith',
  email: 'jane@example.com',
  signed_up_at: '2021-06-14T16:25:49Z'
})

```
Minimal example of sending only userId:
```javascript
usertour.identify('123456')
```
