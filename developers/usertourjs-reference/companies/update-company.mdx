The `updateGroup()` method updates attributes for a company that has already been associated with the current user using `usertour.group()` since the last page load.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="attributes" type="object">
  Company attributes to update. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes) for details. These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.
</ParamField>

## Returns
A `Promise` that resolves when the update is complete.

## Example

```javascript
// Update company attributes
usertour.updateGroup({
  employee_count: 600,
  last_updated: '2024-03-20T08:30:00.000Z',
  subscription_tier: 'enterprise'
});
```

## Notes

- This method only works for companies associated with `usertour.group()`
- Attributes are merged with existing values
- Does not affect the company association
- Can be called multiple times to update different attributes
