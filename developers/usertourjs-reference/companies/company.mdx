title: "group()"
description: "Associate the current user with a company and update company attributes"
---

The `group()` method associates the currently identified user with a company and optionally updates the company's attributes. Call this method once on any page where the user is working with a specific company. When the user switches to a different company, call `usertour.group(newGroupId)` again to update the association.

When you provide `attributes`, they will be merged with the company's existing attributes in Usertour. Attributes not included in the call will retain their current values.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="groupId" type="string" required>
  The unique identifier for the company in your system.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="attributes" type="object">
  Company attributes to update. See [Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes) for details. These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="options.membership" type="object">
  Membership attributes to update for the user's relationship with the company. These attributes describe the user's role or position within the company (e.g., "role", "department", "join_date"). They can be used in the Usertour UI just like company attributes.
</ParamField>

## Returns
A `Promise` that resolves when the group association is complete.

## Example

```javascript
// Associate user with a company and update attributes
usertour.group('comp_123456', {
  name: 'Acme Corp',
  industry: 'Technology',
  employee_count: 500
}, {
  membership: {
    role: 'admin',
    department: 'engineering',
    join_date: '2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'
  }
});
```

## Notes

- Call this method when a user starts working with a specific company
