title: "group()"
---

Associates the currently identified user with a group/company, and optionally updates the group's attributes. You should call this once on any page where the user is working on a specific group. If the user navigates to a different group, simply call usertour.group(newGroupId) again, and Usertour will switch to using that group instead.

If attributes is set, they will be merged into the group's existing attributes in Usertour. Any attributes you leave out will be left as-is in Usertour.

#### Parameters
<ParamField path="groupId" type="string" required>
The group/company's ID in your database.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="attributes" type="object" >
[Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes) to update for the group. These attributes can be used in flow content and conditions to personalize the user experience.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="options.membership" type="object" >
[Attributes](/developers/usertourjs-reference/overview#attributes) to update for the user's membership of the group. Some attributes neither belong on users, nor on groups. One example is a user's "role". A user can have different roles in different groups. A group's members can have different roles. Attributes like "role" are membership attributes. They can be used in the Usertour UI just like group attributes.
</ParamField>

#### Returns 
A `Promise` that resolves once the group call succeeds.
