The `init()` method initializes the Usertour SDK for your environment. This method must be called once per page load before making any other Usertour.js calls.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="token" type="string" required>
  Your Usertour environment token. You can find this token under [Settings â†’ Environments](https://app.usertour.io/project/1/settings/environments). Each environment (e.g., Production, Staging) has its own unique token.
</ParamField>

## Example

```javascript
// Initialize the Usertour SDK with your environment token
usertour.init('USERTOUR_TOKEN');
```

## Notes

- The `init()` method must be called before any other Usertour.js methods
- Each environment (Production, Staging, etc.) requires its own unique token
- The token is used to identify your environment and load the correct configuration
