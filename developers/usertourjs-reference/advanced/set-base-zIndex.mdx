title: "setBaseZIndex()"
description: "Set the base z-index for Usertour floating elements"
---

The `setBaseZIndex()` method sets the minimum z-index value for all Usertour floating elements. By default, Usertour places its elements at or slightly above z-index 1000000. Due to layer stacking, some elements may have z-index values several thousand units higher.

> **Note**: You don't always need to change the base z-index. For specific components like launchers, checklists, and the resource center, you can adjust their individual z-index values through:
> - Launchers: Advanced settings
> - Checklists and Resource Center: Theme settings

## Parameters

<ParamField path="baseZIndex" type="number" required>
  The minimum z-index value for Usertour floating elements. Must be higher than your app's highest z-index to ensure Usertour elements appear above your content.
</ParamField>

## Returns
A `Promise` that resolves when the z-index is updated.

## Example

```javascript
// Set a higher base z-index for Usertour elements
usertour.setBaseZIndex(2000000);
```

## Notes

- Default z-index is 1000000
- Some elements may have higher z-index values due to layer stacking
- Use this method if Usertour elements appear below your app's content
- Consider adjusting individual component z-index values first
- Higher z-index values may affect performance
