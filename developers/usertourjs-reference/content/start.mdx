title: "start()"
description: "Programmatically trigger and display Usertour content for authenticated users"
---
The `start()` method allows you to programmatically trigger and display Usertour content (such as flows, checklists, or other interactive guides) for your authenticated users. When called, the specified content will be rendered immediately in your application.

This method is particularly useful for implementing custom triggers for your user onboarding or feature discovery flows. For instance, you could add a "Replay Tutorial" button in your app's settings, allowing users to revisit your onboarding experience at any time.

## Parameters

<ParamField path="contentId" type="string" required>
String, required - The unique identifier of the content you want to display. You can find this ID in the content detail page URL: `/env/{envId}/{contentType}/{contentId}/detail`
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="options" type="object" >
Optional configuration object to customize the content display behavior.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="options.once" type="boolean" >
When set to true, the content will only be shown to users who haven't seen it before. If the user has already viewed the content, nothing will happen. Defaults to false.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="options.continue" type="boolean" >
When set to true, the content will resume from where the user left off in their previous session. If false, the content will start from the beginning. Defaults to false.
</ParamField>

<Note>
When `once: true` is set, the `continue` option will not take effect since the content will only be shown once to the user.
</Note>

## Return
Returns a `Promise` that resolves when the content has been successfully initialized and displayed.

## Example

### Basic Usage
```javascript
usertour.start('cmaw8v1ch013s147h0uw8aha5');

### Show Content Only Once
```javascript
usertour.start('cmaw8v1ch013s147h0uw8aha5', {
  once: true
});
```

### Resume Previous Session
```javascript
usertour.start('cmaw8v1ch013s147h0uw8aha5', {
