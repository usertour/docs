## What is a Flow?

Think of a flow as your product's friendly tour guide. Just like you'd show a friend around your home, a flow helps new users explore your product, discover its features, and get started with confidence.

A flow appears as an interactive overlay in your app that helps users:
- Get familiar with your product
- Find features they might not know about
- Complete important tasks with ease
- Get help right when they need it

Each step in your flow is a different way to connect with your users. You can use:
- Modals for important announcements
- Tooltips for quick feature tips
- Slideouts for detailed information
- Checklists for complex tasks

The best part about flows is how flexible they are. You can mix these different types to create exactly the experience your users need. For example, you might:
- Show a single modal to announce a new feature
- Create a multi-step tour to welcome new users
- Add a tooltip to highlight a specific button
- Use a checklist to guide users through a complex task

## Best Practices

Creating great flows is all about understanding your users and their needs. Here are some tips to help you create flows that users will love:

### Keep It Simple
Less is more! Aim for five steps or less in your flows. Use friendly, clear language and focus on one thing at a time. Too much information at once can be overwhelming.

### Know Your Users
Different users need different guidance. A new user needs more help than someone who's been using your product for months. Make sure you're showing the right content to the right people at the right time.

### Start With a Goal
Before you start building, ask yourself: "What do I want my users to learn or accomplish?" Whether it's discovering a new feature or completing a complex task, having a clear goal will help you create more effective flows.

### Make It Feel Natural
Your flows should feel like a natural part of your product. Use consistent styling, make navigation intuitive, and always let users skip if they want to. Don't forget to test your flows on different devices to ensure everyone has a great experience.
