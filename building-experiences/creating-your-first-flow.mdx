## Getting Started

Before you can start creating flows, you'll need to install [Usertour.js](/developers/usertourjs-reference/installation) in your web application. Once that's done, you're ready to create your first flow!

## Examples
### Page navigation in flow

## Theme
Make your flows look and feel just right for your application. With themes, you can customize colors, typography, and overall styling to match your brand.

## Tooltip Placement (Tooltips only)
You can target elements using CSS Selector, with optional Element Text for more precise selection:

- **CSS Selector**: Required for targeting elements. Use any valid CSS selector to specify which element to target
  - Works with all standard CSS selectors (see [MDN's CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors))
  - Uses `querySelectorAll()` to find elements
  - When multiple elements match, Usertour picks the first one
  - You can specify which element to select by providing its index

- **Element Text**: Optional. Use this when you need to distinguish between elements that share the same CSS selector but have different text content

  allowfullscreen

## Tooltip Alignment (Tooltips only)
Fine-tune how your tooltips align with their target elements:
- Choose your alignment mode:
  - **Auto**: Tooltip will automatically adjust to the best available position if the preferred alignment doesn't fit
  - **Fixed**: Tooltip will maintain the exact alignment you specify, regardless of available space
- When using Fixed mode, choose from multiple alignment options:
  - Left: left-start, left-center, left-end
  - Right: right-start, right-center, right-end
  - Top: top-start, top-center, top-end
  - Bottom: bottom-start, bottom-center, bottom-end
- Each alignment option determines how the tooltip connects to its target element
- Preview the alignment in real-time in the builder

## Backdrop
The backdrop helps keep users focused:
- Creates a semi-transparent overlay
- Highlights important elements
- Prevents interaction with background content
- Works with all step types:
  - Modal steps: Always on
  - Tooltip steps: Optional
  - Customize in theme settings

## Actions
For each step, you can set up actions that happen when:
- Users click buttons
- Users interact with tooltip targets
- Step trigger conditions are met

Here's what you can do:
- **Go to step** - Jump to any step in your flow. Perfect for creating non-linear flows and conditional paths.
- **Dismiss** - End the current flow. You can trigger this through code or user interaction.
- **Start new flow** - Switch to a different flow while ending the current one. Great for smooth transitions between experiences.
- **Navigate to page** - Open a specific URL in the browser. Choose between same-tab or new-tab navigation.
- **Evaluate javascript** - Run custom JavaScript code in your application. This lets you integrate deeply with your app's features.

## Step Triggers

Triggers let you create smart flows with **"if this, then that"** rules. Before showing each step, if a trigger is active, it'll run its logic first. You can:

- Add multiple triggers to a step
- Create branching flows
- Skip steps based on conditions

A trigger can have the following conditions:

- **User attribute** - Execute the trigger's action when a user possesses specific attributes, enabling personalized flow progression.
- **Current page is** - Execute the trigger's action when users navigate to a designated page, ensuring context-aware flow delivery.
- **Element is present/clicked/disabled** - Execute the trigger's action based on UI element states. Particularly useful for handling asynchronous content loading scenarios.
- **Text input value is** - Execute the trigger's action when users enter specific values in designated input fields, enabling precise form-based flow control.
- **User fills in input** - Execute the trigger's action upon any user input in specified fields, facilitating real-time flow progression.
- **Current time** - Execute the trigger's action at designated times, allowing for time-sensitive content delivery within specific time periods.

<Tip>
Best Practice: Add triggers to visible steps to prevent users from getting stuck.

## Reordering Steps

Want to change the order of your steps? Just drag and drop them to rearrange your flow.

<Tip>
Feel free to add new steps or rearrange existing ones to create the perfect user journey.

## Starting a Flow

Once you've set up your flow, you'll need to know how to start it for your users. For the full details on starting flows, check out the [Starting Flow/Checklist Guide](/how-to-guides/starting-flows).

<Note>
Remember to install [Usertour.js](/developers/usertourjs-reference/installation) in your application to start flows for your users.
</Note>

## Temporarily Hiding Flows

To show flows only on specific pages:
1. Turn on **Temporarily hide flow**
2. Set your visibility conditions

<Tip>
Use auto-start conditions for targeting flows instead of temporary hiding.
</Tip>

  allowfullscreen

## Dismissing Flows

Users can end a flow anytime by clicking the X-button in the top-right corner of modals and tooltips. While you can disable this button in advanced settings, we recommend keeping it enabled. You can add **Dismiss** actions to buttons, tooltip target clicks, survey questions, and step triggers. When starting a new flow, the current one will automatically end. For other actions like page navigation, you'll need to add a **Dismiss** action yourself.

On the last step of a flow, we recommend adding a **Dismiss** action to give users a clear way to end the flow. If you use **Start a flow** to begin another flow, the current one will automatically end. This automatic ending doesn't happen with other actions like **Navigate to page** - you'll need to add a **Dismiss** action yourself.

Make sure your flow is properly dismissed (or hidden using temporarily hide), as an undismissed flow will prevent other flows from starting.

<Warning>
Currently, flows have a 24-hour session lifecycle. This prevents flows from getting stuck undismissed and blocking other flows permanently. In the future, you'll be able to configure this duration through the Usertour.js API.
</Warning>

## Flow Completion

Flow completion is different from dismissal. A flow is complete when users reach the completion step, which is automatically set as the last step. If you want the flow to complete only after a specific button click on the last step, add a hidden step after the button step with an unconditional trigger and **Dismiss** action.
