## Getting Started

Before you can start creating flows, you'll need to install [Usertour.js](/developers/usertourjs-reference/installation) in your web application. Once that's done, you're ready to create your first flow!

## Creating a New Flow

Let's create your first flow in the Usertour web app:

1. Open the Usertour web app and navigate to the **Content** section
2. Click on **Flows** in the sidebar
3. Click the **Create New Flow** button
4. Give your flow a descriptive name

## Building Your Flow

Here's how to create an engaging user experience:

### Customization Options

#### Theme
Customize the look and feel of your flows to match your application's design. Themes let you control colors, typography, and overall styling.

#### Element Placement (Tooltips only)
You have multiple ways to target elements for your tooltips:

- **Element Text**: If you enter text here, Usertour will find and select elements containing that text
- **CSS Selector**: For precise targeting, you can use any valid CSS selector
  - Supports all standard CSS selectors (see [MDN's CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors))
  - Uses `querySelectorAll()` for element selection
  - When multiple elements match, Usertour selects the first one by default
  - You can specify which element to select by providing its index

#### Backdrop
The backdrop feature helps focus user attention:

- Creates a semi-transparent overlay
- Highlights important elements
- Blocks interactions with background content
- Available for all step types:
  - Modal steps: Enabled by default
  - Tooltip steps: Optional per step
  - Customizable in theme settings

#### Actions
Control how your flow behaves:

- Set step triggers
- Define navigation behavior
- Configure close button actions
- Customize user interactions

#### Tooltip Positioning
Position tooltips precisely:

- Choose from multiple positions (left, right, above, below)
- Automatic fallback if space is limited
- Visual positioning in the builder

### Managing Flow Steps

Need to change the order of your steps? No problem! Simply drag and drop steps to rearrange them in your flow.
