## Getting Started

Before you can start creating flows, you'll need to install [Usertour.js](/developers/usertourjs-reference/installation) in your web application. Once that's done, you're ready to create your first flow!

## Creating a New Flow

To create a new flow in Usertour, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to **Flows** in the sidebar
2. Click **Create flow**
3. Enter a name for your flow
4. Click the **Submit** button

## Add Step 

Follow these steps to add a step:

1. Navigate to the flow detail page
2. Click **Edit in builder** at the top
3. Click the **Create** button on the left side of the builder
4. Select a **Step Type** (Tooltip, Modal, Hidden)
5. Edit the Step content

## Theme
Customize the look and feel of your flows to match your application's design. Themes let you control colors, typography, and overall styling.

## Tooltip Placement (Tooltips only)
You can precisely target elements using either Element Text or CSS Selector:

- **Element Text**: If you enter text here, Usertour will find and select elements containing that text
- **CSS Selector**: For precise targeting, you can use any valid CSS selector
  - Supports all standard CSS selectors (see [MDN's CSS Selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors))
  - Uses `querySelectorAll()` for element selection
  - When multiple elements match, Usertour selects the first one by default
  - You can specify which element to select by providing its index

## Tooltip Positioning (Tooltips only)
Position tooltips precisely:

- Choose from multiple positions (left, right, above, below)
- Automatic fallback if space is limited
- Visual positioning in the builder

## Backdrop
The backdrop feature helps focus user attention:

- Creates a semi-transparent overlay
- Highlights important elements
- Blocks interactions with background content
- Available for all step types:
  - Modal steps: Enabled by default
  - Tooltip steps: Optional per step
  - Customizable in theme settings

## Actions
For each flow step, you can configure actions triggered by:
- Button clicks
- Tooltip target interactions
- Step trigger conditions

Available actions:
- **Go to step** - Navigate to a specific step within the current flow. This action enables non-linear flow progression and conditional branching.
- **Dismiss** - Terminate the current flow session. This action can be triggered programmatically or through user interaction.
- **Start new flow** - Initialize a different flow while automatically terminating the current one. This enables seamless transitions between different user experiences.
- **Navigate to page** - Redirect users to a specified URL. Supports both same-tab and new-tab navigation modes for optimal user experience.
- **Evaluate javascript** - Execute custom JavaScript code within the context of your application. This enables deep integration with your application's functionality and custom event handling.

## Step Triggers

Triggers enable you to create conditional flows with "if this, then that" rules. Before each step is displayed, if a trigger is activated, its logic will be executed first. You can:

- Add multiple triggers to a single step
- Create branching flows
- Skip steps based on conditions

A trigger can have the following conditions:

- **User attribute** - Trigger the next step when a user possesses specific attributes, enabling personalized flow progression.
- **Current page is** - Trigger the next step when users navigate to a designated page, ensuring context-aware flow delivery.
- **Element is present/clicked/disabled** - Trigger the next step based on UI element states. Particularly useful for handling asynchronous content loading scenarios.
- **Text input value is** - Trigger the next step when users enter specific values in designated input fields, enabling precise form-based flow control.
- **User fills in input** - Trigger the next step upon any user input in specified fields, facilitating real-time flow progression.
- **Current time** - Trigger the next step at designated times, allowing for time-sensitive content delivery within specific time periods.

<Tip>
Best Practice: Add triggers to visible steps to prevent users from getting stuck.

## Reordering Steps

Need to change the order of your steps? No problem! Simply drag and drop steps to rearrange them in your flow.

<Tip>
You can always add new steps or rearrange existing ones to create the perfect user journey.

## Starting a Flow

After configuring your flow, you'll need to understand how to start it for end users. For detailed information about starting flows, refer to the [Starting Flow/Checklist Guide](/how-to-guides/starting-flows).

<Note>
To start flows for end-users, you'll need to install [Usertour.js](/developers/usertourjs-reference/installation) in your application.
</Note>

## Temporarily Hiding Flows

To show flows only on specific pages:
1. Enable "Temporarily hide flow" in advanced settings
2. Set your visibility conditions

<Tip>
Best Practice: Use auto-start conditions for flow targeting rather than temporary hiding.
</Tip>

## Dismissing Flows

Users can dismiss a flow at any time using the X-button in the top-right corner of modals and tooltips. While this button can be disabled in advanced settings, it's generally not recommended. **Dismiss** actions can be added to buttons, tooltip target clicks, survey questions, and step triggers. When starting a new flow, the current flow will be automatically dismissed. For other actions like page navigation, you'll need to add a dismiss action explicitly.

On the last step of a flow, we recommend always adding a dismiss action to provide a clear call-to-action for ending the flow. If you use a **Start a flow** action to start another flow, the current flow will be automatically dismissed. This automatic dismissal does not apply to other actions such as **Navigate to page**, where you'll need to add a **Dismiss** action yourself.

Always ensure that the flow is properly dismissed (or hidden using temporarily hide), as an undismissed flow will block other flows from starting. 

<Warning>
Currently, the session lifecycle is set to 24 hours. This limitation is designed to prevent scenarios where a flow remains undismissed due to unexpected circumstances, which could otherwise permanently block other flows from starting. In the future, this lifecycle duration will be configurable through the Usertour.js API.
</Warning>

## Flow Completion

Flow completion is different from dismissal. A flow is considered complete when the user reaches a completion step, which is automatically set as the last step by default. If you want the flow to complete only after a specific button click on the last step, add a hidden step after the button step with an unconditional trigger and **Dismiss** action.
