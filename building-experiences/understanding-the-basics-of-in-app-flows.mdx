## What is a Flow?

Imagine you're giving a guided tour of your product to a new user. You'd want to show them around, point out important features, and help them get started. That's exactly what a flow does in your application.

A flow is like having a friendly guide right inside your product. It appears as an interactive overlay that helps users:
- Learn the ropes of your product
- Discover cool features they might have missed
- Get through important tasks step by step
- Find help exactly when they need it

Think of each step in your flow as a different way to communicate with your users. You can use:
- Modals to make important announcements
- Tooltips to give quick tips about specific features
- Slideouts to share more detailed information
- Checklists to guide users through complex tasks

The beauty of flows is their flexibility. You can mix and match these patterns to create the perfect experience for your users. Maybe you want to:
- Announce a new feature with a single modal
- Welcome new users with a multi-step tour
- Highlight a specific button with a tooltip
- Guide users through a complex task with a checklist

## Best Practices

Creating great flows is both an art and a science. Here are some tips to help you create flows that users love:

### Keep It Simple
Remember, less is more. Keep your flows short and sweet - five steps or less is usually perfect. Use clear, friendly language and focus on one thing at a time. You don't want to overwhelm your users with too much information at once.

### Know Your Audience
Think about who you're creating the flow for. A new user needs different guidance than someone who's been using your product for months. Show the right content to the right users at the right time.

### Plan With Purpose
Before you start creating, think about what you want to achieve. Are you helping users discover a new feature? Or guiding them through a complex task? Having a clear goal will help you create more effective flows.

### Design for Success
Make your flows look and feel like a natural part of your product. Use consistent styling, make navigation clear, and always give users the option to skip if they want to. And don't forget to test your flows on different devices to ensure a great experience for everyone.
